# Game Boy Axelay Demo

Game Boy demake of a NES demake of the SNES game Axelay. A short tech demo showing pseudo mode-7 background and sprite scaling effects on the Game Boy and Game Boy Color.

ROM downloadable at: https://bbbbbr.itch.io/gameboy-axelay

- Runs on actual hardware
- Mostly runs at 60 FPS
- No Music
- Collision detection in the ROM is a quick and naive implementation only for shots -> boulders (working version of it is not in the repo)
- Built with GBDK-2020, mostly C and some asm

The NES demake that inspired this: https://twitter.com/upsilandre/status/1110517612574883840â€‹

Code is kind of a sloppy work in progress, not cleaned up. No current plans to develop it further.
